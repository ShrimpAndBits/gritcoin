# What you say?

Gritcoin is the world's first, only, and best git-based, grain-themed currency.

# Where do Gritcoin come from?

Coins are created through a patent-pending process called Milling.  Its nature
is as mysterious and strange as it is wonderful and erotic.

# THE COB #

The kernel of the matter is THE COB - a sequential record of currency
events ordered into neat little rows.  For reasons obscure, THE COB must
always be written in all caps.

THE COB is a markdown file.  Each line is a niblet.  Niblets are a space-
delimited collection of fields.  There are 2 kinds of niblets:

* millings - The creation of one or more new coins is a milling.  The
fields of a milling are:

   * dash - a literal '-'
   * milling - this literal string
   * number of coins - a positive, non-zero integer
   * recipient - github username of the recipient of the new coins
   * note - up to 1024 bytes of optional additional text associated with the milling.  OK to contain spaces.

* givings - The transfer of one or more coins from one person to another.
The fields of a giving are:

   * dash - a literal '-'
   * giving - this literal string
   * number of coins - a positive, non-zero integer
   * donor - github username of the donor of the new coins
   * recipient - github username of the recipient of the new coins
   * note - up to 1024 bytes of optional additional text associated with the milling.  OK to contain spaces.

A simple version of THE COB might look like:

    - milling 10 Alice A wonderful bounty for Alice.
    - giving 3 Alice @Bob Bob was nice, he gets some coins.
    - milling 5 @Bob An oil strike, but not as large as Alice's.
    - giving 8 @Bob Alice Bob's wallet is empty, but his heart is full.

Here are some invalid niblets:

    giving 7 Alice Bob Where the dash at?
    - monkey 14 Alice Bob Monkey?
    - giving 3.4 Bob Alice No fractions!
    - milling 0 Alice No no-ops!
    - milling -46 Bob That's just silly.

# Making a Transfer #

Got some Gritcoin?  Want to feel the pleasure of giving?  Here's what
you gotta do:

1. Load [THE COB](THECOB.md) in your browser.  If you don't have a github account, 
then make one.  If you do have one, but you ain't logged in, then log in.

2. Edit THE COB by clicking the little pencil icon.  This will fork the gritcoin
respository (if it's your first time) and create a branch.

3. Add your new niblets to the end of THE COB.

4. If you are feeling up to it, enter a short description of your changes in the
box where it says "Update THECOB.md".

5. Enter a haiku in the larger box where it says "Add an optional extended description...".

6. Click the green 'Propose file change' button.

7. Click the green 'Create pull request' button.

8. Write some sort of corny pun in the little box where it says 'Update THECOB.md'.

9. Put whatever tickles your fancy (or nothing at all) in the larger box where it says
'Leave a comment'.

10. Click the green 'Create pull request' button.

Your niblet is now in the system for processing.  Algorhythms will check that
the changes are valid before including them into the HEAD of the master branch
of the main repo.  Depending on your github settings, you will probably get an
email when this happens.
